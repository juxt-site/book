== Start the Site instance

It is now time to start the Site instance, which runs on a JVM on your local machine.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Start the Site instance:

----
$SITE_HOME/server/bin/site-server
----

In order to run both instances for auth and data, you will need to change the SITE_PORT and ADMIN_PORT environmental variables in the shell where you run the server. Alternatively if you are using the `start` function, you will just need to point to the correct config file name in your config directory E.G., `config-data` for the data server.

Check the server starts up by looking out for a message on the console similar to the following:

----
Site by JUXT. Copyright (c) 2020-2023, JUXT LTD.
2023-05-22 11:02:46.508:INFO::main: Logging initialized @5804ms to org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.StdErrLog
...
2023-06-21 12:36:00,180 INFO  juxt.site.main: System started and ready... [ thread=main]
----

== Check the status of the instance

Check the server is up by calling an endpoint with curl:

----
curl http://localhost:4444/_site/healthcheck
----

This should report:

----
Site OK!
