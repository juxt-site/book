= Configuration with `site`
:toc: left

Before you begin this chapter, make sure you have a record of the _client secret_ you were given in <<initialisation>>.

== Request a token

Request the token with the command you were given in <<initialisation>>.

In general, this is a call to `site request-token`, providing _client secret_.
This gives us sufficient access to the system to create an admin user account.

[NOTE]
--
By default, the access token is saved into the `$HOME/.curlrc` config file.
This means you can use *curl* to access the Site API if you prefer.
--

== Check the token

Any time you have succesfully acquired a token, you can check the token's validity with `site check-token`.
If things aren't working, it's possible you no longer have a token, or it has expired.

[source]
----
site check-token
----

You can also find out the user (or application) that your token with authenticate as.

[source]
----
site whoami
----

The `site whoami` task can be given a `-v` option to show much more information.
This is particularly useful for debugging:

[source]
----
site whoami -v
----

[NOTE]
--
You should notice that your token you received using the client secret has the roles `http://localhost:4444/_site/roles/Bootstrap` and `http://localhost:4444/_site/roles/SystemQuery`.

[[create-a-user]]
== Create a user

To create a user we need to craft a JSON object that contains a username, but can contain any other data as necessary.

We can create a user with `site register-user`, as shown in <<ex-create-a-user>>.

[[ex-create-a-user]]
.Creating a user with a password
====
To create a user with the username `alice`, and a password, we can do the following:

----
site register-user --username alice --fullname "Alice Carroll" --password $(gum input --password)
----

Alternatively, if we have *jo* installed we can create the necessary JSON for a user with username `alice`.
We can then pipe this JSON into curl to create the user.

----
jo username=alice fullname="Alice Carroll" password=$(gum input --password) \
| curl --json @- http://localhost:4444/_site/users
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
--
Create a user to represent yourself as shown in <<ex-create-a-user>>.
--

If successful, we should be able to view the user by querying for the full list of users:

----
site users
----

Alternatively, we can use *curl*:

----
curl http://localhost:4444/_site/users
----

This will output the collection of users:

----
[ {
  "juxt.site/username" : "alice",
  "fullname" : "Alice Carroll",
  "xt/id" : "http://localhost:4444/_site/users/alice"
} ]
----

== Assigning users the `Admin` role

We will need to continue to run certain administrative tasks which are only permitted to particular users.

We will need at least one user that has been granted these permissions.

For example, to assign the `SiteAdmin` role to `alice`, we would do the following:

[source]
----
site assign-user-role --username alice --role SiteAdmin
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Assign the `SiteAdmin` role to the user you created in <<create-a-user>>.
--

== Acquiring a bearer token using our user's password

Now that we have created a user, assigned to the `Admin` role, we can replace our token with one representing our new user.

----
site request-token --username alice --password password=$(gum input --password)
----

[IMPORTANT]
--
Request a new access token using the username and password for the user you have just created.
--

We'll use this new bearer token to continue configuring our Site instance.

== Bundles

Resources in Site are created as a result of a user performing operations with arguments.
Very often, groups of these operations are performed together, as a _bundle_.
When we _install_ a _bundle_, we request a number of operations be performed with certain arguments.

Bundles are usually stored as a hierarchical tree of files outside of Site, usually in a source-code (version) control system such as *git*.

By default, the `site` tool points at the directory called `installers` under `$SITE_HOME`.

To list the bundles in the tree:

----
site bundles
----

To install a bundle, use the `site install-bundle` command.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install the following bundles:

----
site install juxt/site/system-api-openapi
----

Install the OAuth2 authorization endpoint, selecting the password login.

----
site install juxt/site/oauth-authorization-endpoint
----

We'll also need to install a login form:

----
site install juxt/site/login-form
----

Finally, register the Swagger UI client:

----
site install juxt/site/system-client --client-id swagger-ui
----

--

== Check the System API with Swagger

[IMPORTANT]
--
Browse to https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=http://localhost:4444/_site/openapi.json
--

Click on Authorize and scroll to the implicit grant-type.

Add `swagger-ui` for the `client-id` and select all the available scopes.

TIP: Try accessing some of the API endpoints by opening some operations and clicking on the 'Try it out' button.

== Install the Petstore demo API

[IMPORTANT]
--
[source]
----
site install-openapi $SITE_HOME/demo/openapi.json
200 Successfully installed API: Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0 (version 1.0.17)
----

----
site install demo/petstore/operations
----

----
site assign-user-role --username alice --role SiteAdmin
----

Alternatively, the above steps are all wrapped into the following command
----
site install-petstore
----
--

== Check the Petstore API with Swagger

[IMPORTANT]
--
Browse to https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=http://localhost:4444/petstore/openapi.json
At this point you can authorize and test the APIs, or use curl to check that the API is working.
