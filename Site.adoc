= Foundations

In keeping with our value of <<understanding,Understanding>>, we recommended that you invest time in building up both your working and conceptual knowledge of Site.

The chapters in this part of the book will help to build up your knowledge of Site 'from scratch'.

= Authentication

(((authentication, definition)))
Authentication is the process by which a user is identified.

(((access control)))
In Site, Operations are integrated with authorization rules, providing a rich access control
layer between users and data.

(((Subject)))
Most authorization rules refer to the Subject of the request. To identify the
Subject, we need to authenticate each request.

Site supports two types of user authentication:

(((authentication,HTTP))) *HTTP Authentication*, which introduces the concept of _protection spaces_, specified in cite:[rfc7235], is described in <<ch-http-authentication>>.
An example of HTTP Authentication is the 'Basic' authentication scheme, which is covered in <<ch-basic-authentication>>.

(((authentication,session-based))) *Session-based Authentication*, which we describe in <<ch-session-authentication>>, opens up numerous additional options for authentication.
One such option is authenticating via an HTML form, which is covered in <<ch-form-based-authentication>>.
Another is with the OpenID Connect protocol, which is covered in <<ch-openid>> with a worked example.

= Applications and APIs

First, in <<ch-applications>>, we introduce applications and create the required actions.

We start by configuring our authorization server in <<ch-authorization-server>>.

Then, in <<ch-first-application>>, we create an example application.

This is the forthcoming part on Site deployment.

[[pt-principles]]
= Design Principles

Site is designed according to a set of design principles.

This part presents and discusses these principles, in the hope that they will continue to be maintained in the future.

Few data systems built today exhibit more than a handful of these principles.
